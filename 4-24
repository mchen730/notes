class vs object vs instance vs reference
object = instance (iPhone = new MobliePhone ( "apple", false, 1, "AT&T"))
iPhone is a reference (address)
MobliePhone is the object itself
System.out.println(iPhone) (print is using the address to access the object)
java always pass by "VALUE"
the value of a variable is the address
The value of a primitive type is its vaule
Have to have a toString function to print variable
The value of an address type is its reference ("memory address")

complexity (worse case scenario)
Big O notation
O(1), O(n), O(lgn), O(nlgn) those are presenting the worse scenario. "o" read as "order of"
speed of increase as n grows
array -> linked list ( 12 -> 13 -> 9 -> 10) infinite space between them
